# GitHub Lines

GitHub Lines is a bot, currently only available in Discord, that displays one or more lines when mentioned in a GitHub link.
It also supports syntax higlighting!

Example:

You can add the bot to your server by clicking [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=708282735227174922&permissions=10240&scope=bot)

## Commands

GitHub Lines has a few commands that you can use, although no commands are necessary to display the lines. The prefix for the commands is ";"

 1. `;help` - Returns a list of commands
 2. `;about` - Returns some info about the bot
 3. `;invite` or `;topgg` - Returns the link for the bot's top.gg page, from where you can invite the bot to your server
 4. `;ping` - Returns the bot's latency

## Running your own

To run the bot yourself, follow these simple steps:

 1. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/diogoscf/github-lines.git`)
 2. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and paste your Discord bot token (obtain one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)) after `TOKEN=`
 3. Run `npm install`
 4. Run `npm start`
